    /*
        The following examples show how to parse the various KST3320 uplinks.
        The below are the data types for the KST3320:
        0x82 = Distance
        0x78 = Battery
        0x88 = GPS & Extended GPS (If ADR is supported)
        
        The first byte will be the LoRa Channel which will equal 0x01 for each data type.
        
        Here is an example of a Distance uplink: 
        01 82 00 36
         0  1  2  3
        
        Decoded, that appears as:
        * LoRa Channel: 0x01 = 1
        * Distance Data Type: 0x82 = 130
        * Distance: 0x0036 = 54mm
         
        Here is an example of the Battery uplink:
        01 78 63
         0  1  2
        
        Decoded, that appears as:
        * LoRa Channel: 0x01 = 1
        * Battery Data Type: 0x78 = 120
        * Battery: 0x63 = 99%
        
        Here is an example of a GPS uplink:
        01 88 05 F3 71 F0 06 17 03 72 EE
         0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
        
        Decoded, that appears as:
        * LoRa Channel: 0x01 = 1
        * GPS Data Type: 0x88 = 136
        * Latitude: 0x05F371 = 39.0001째
        * Longitude: 0xF00617 = 104.7016째
        * Altitude: 0x0372EE = 2260.30 meters
        
        Here is an example of an Extended GPS uplink:
        01 88 05 F3 71 F0 06 17 03 72 EE 00 01 8D 80 00 00 FA 36 04
         0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19
        
        Decoded, that appears as:
        * LoRa Channel: 0x01 = 1
        * GPS Data Type: 0x88 = 136
        * Latitude: 0x05F371 = 39.0001째
        * Longitude: 0xF00617 = 104.7016째
        * Altitude: 0x0372EE = 2260.30 meters
        * Horizontal Accuracy: 0x00018D80 = 101.760 meters
        * Vertical Accuracy: 0x0000FA36 = 64.054 meters
        * # of Satellites: 0x04 = 4
        
        Helium Console offers the ability to test your decoder by using the
        Script Validator. It is encouraged that you paste the Byte-level
        examples above and ensure your decoder is correct before deploying
        to your server.
